      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>S. Senthamizh Selvan</strong> — someone who finds joy in building, learning, and exploring the endless possibilities of technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever since I wrote my first program, I’ve been captivated by how code can turn imagination into reality. Technology, for me, is not just a tool — it's a language of expression, a path to solve real problems, and a canvas to create meaningful impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m deeply curious about how things work — from the logic behind algorithms to the intelligence behind modern AI systems. This curiosity drives me to keep learning, breaking things, fixing them, and growing from every challenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in simplicity, honesty, and purposeful work. Whether I’m building a small utility app or diving into large-scale systems, I care about doing it thoughtfully — with clarity, empathy, and intention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the code, I’m someone who values meaningful conversations, collaborative energy, and the quiet satisfaction of solving a problem that once felt impossible. I’m not here to just write software — I’m here to learn, evolve, and leave things better than I found them.
      </p>
